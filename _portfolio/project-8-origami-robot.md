Development of an origami-inspired robotic manipulator with a folding and unfolding mechanism. This design enhances mobility in the folded state for mobile robots and improves manipulability in the unfolded state, making it suitable for volume-efficient and human-interactable applications such as warehouse operations.

* **Thesis**
    * [Origami-Inspired Robotic Manipulator](/files/Origami-inspired Multi DOF Robotic Arm.pdf)

* **Motivation**
    * The lack of an unfolding mechanism in [An origami-inspired, self-locking robotic arm](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/scirobotics.aar2915) limits its applications to drone-based robotic arms.
    * The demand for lightweight, volume-efficient robotic manipulators capable of human interaction in warehouse environments.
* **Contributions**
    * Designed elongated folded lines using the origami perpendicular principle to avoid over-folded states.
    * Achieved a functional folding and unfolding mechanism applicable to mobile robotic manipulators, increasing mobility in the folded state and enhancing manipulability in the unfolded state.
