Kinematic calibration methods to improve the accuracy of robotic tooth preparation based on Modified Denavit-Hartenberg (MDH) parameters and local Product of Exponential (POE) formulation.

* **Motivation**
    * Addressing the need for precise robotic tooth preparation by improving accuracy within the robot‚Äôs workspace.
* **Contributions**
    * Designed and implemented a calibration point generation algorithm to enhance accuracy of robot in tooth preparation workspace.
    * Implemented a rotary joint axis estimation algorithm [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9082007).
    * Developed a kinematic calibration algorithm based on Modified Denavit-Hartenberg (MDH) parameters, incorporating an additional parameter ùõΩ [2](https://mrce.in/ebooks/Robotics-Springer%20Handbook%20of%20Robotics%202nd%20Ed.pdf).
    * Implemented kinematics calibration algorithm based on local Product of Exponential (POE) formulation [[2]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094114X01000489?casa_token=LWYCmB-YBm4AAAAA:zsYSq7C6b1NyZKUHTZFTW_-VnV3t6MTAOoJTLsnwy5pHwDGriK58DRz9R0S56UjW6IFRADb5xg) [[3]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6834832).
