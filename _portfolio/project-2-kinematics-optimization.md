This project presents a comprehensive framework for the kinematic and functional optimization of dental robotic systems using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The framework is parameterized by trajectory requirements and performance measures, ensuring adaptability for diverse robotic automation applications. This research is the first to define the optimal kinematics and installation base pose of a robotic manipulator for decay removal and tooth preparation. The proposed methodology can be generalized for various robotic automation tasks by adjusting its parameters to fit specific applications.
