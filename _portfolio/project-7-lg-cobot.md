Development of a 6-DoF collaborative robot manipulator designed for versatile applications, including automation in the Food & Beverage industry and Robot Production Systems (RPS). The robot incorporates safety features and advanced vision capabilities to enhance human-robot interaction and operational efficiency.

* **Motivation**
    * Industrial robot arms in RPS often lack safety features, limiting their use alongside human workers.
    * Manual teaching of robot manipulators to grasp diverse product types in RPS is time-consuming and inefficient.
* **Contributions**
    *  Designed and developed a 6-DoF collaborative robot for multi-purpose applications, incorporating safety features for effective human-robot collaboration.
    * Implemented an autonomous vision calibration method, enabling vision-based control for precise manipulator operations.
* **Skills**:
    * Collaborative Robot Manipulator, Computer Vision, Image Segmentation, Hand-Eye-Calibration
    * OpenCV, Solidworks, Creo, AutoCAD
