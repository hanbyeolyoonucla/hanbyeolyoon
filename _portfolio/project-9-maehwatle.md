* **Motivation**
    * Growing demand for microbiome datasets to support research on correlations between microbiomes and various diseases (e.g., diabetes, obesity, Alzheimerâ€™s).
    * Need to alleviate the discomfort associated with conventional fecal sampling methods and to enhance the reliability of stool samples through an automated process.
* **Contributions**
    * Designed and developed an autonomous microbiome diagnosis system integrating a robotic manipulator for fecal sampling and a third-generation DNA sequencer for real-time analysis.
    * Created a one-click sampling mechanism, simplifying the fecal sampling process, and a sampling platform for microbiome dataset generation.
    * Recognized by the Korea Foundation for the Advancement of Science & Creativity (KOFAC), Seoul National University (SNU) Entrepreneur Center, and the Ministry of SMEs and Startups (MSS).
